        <p class="lead mb-4">Undergraduate Biology major at UC Riverside Class of 2021<br><br>

        In September 2017, I attended the University of California, Riverside as an undergraduate freshman with a declared biology major in a bachelorâ€™s in science. Throughout my undergraduate years, I was fortunate enough to spend three and a half years experiencing campus life prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a resident from Northern California, I was able to live independently away from home and experience both the dorm life as a freshman and the off-campus apartment life with roommates I am still close with. 
<br><br>

       Initially, I was never truly sure of what I wanted to do with my biology degree after I graduate with my bachelorâ€™s at UCR. Biology is such a broad subject that covers a wide range of disciplines, so I was amazed at some students who knew exactly what they wanted to do with their lives in terms of career planning. Luckily, I wasnâ€™t alone, and I was also surrounded by peers who had an idea of what life would be like after college, but they never had a plan set in stone. The idea of planning a future immediately after college sounded anxiety-inducing at first, but thankfully I had an amazing support system (parents, friends, classmates, faculty staff) who constantly give me advice on what I should do.<br><br>
       As I reflect on my years spent in UCR, I realize just how much I highly enjoyed both my lower division and upper division biology courses. Whether or not they were required to complete my degree audit, I always loved learning about such a wide range of topics that can stem from biology, chemistry, physics, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and so on. At least with my lower division courses, I had the opportunity to be exposed to an academic laboratory setting where I could apply the material that I learned from my lectures and actively participate in several experiments that were facilitated by graduate teaching assistants. <br><br>
        That being said, I realize that I can do so much with my biology degree after being exposed to so many different fields of biology. As of now, my current plan is to pursue an additional bachelorâ€™s degree in nursing, in which I can fully expose myself to a healthcare setting. And then, if I choose to do so, I also have the option of pursuing a higher degree (i.e. masterâ€™s program or PhD program) in a specific discipline. Since UCR does not have a nursing program, I am choosing to finish any additional prerequisites at a community college before I begin the application process. If possible, I would like the opportunity to gain experience in a hospital or clinical setting. Other opportunities that I am also interested in include lab internship and/or research lab assistant positions. I would like to apply the knowledge I gained from my undergraduate studies into a more professional, career-oriented setting.
        Though no plan is ever truly finalized, I am much more optimistic about this path I am taking to achieving my goals. I will be graduating from UCR in June 2021, and I am looking forward to enhancing my personal and professional skills in the real world.
